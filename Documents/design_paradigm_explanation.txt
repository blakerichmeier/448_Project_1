Document to hold the explanation on what our group thinks the previous group used for their design paradigm

The design paradigm that we think the previous team used was object oriented programming. This is because of the all the different classes that have been presented, as well as the way the code is set up. For example, the flow of the battleships program is done in the Executive.cpp file, and in this file there are a bunch of objects that are generated. There is a game board object that is generated, a user interface object, and also we made an AI class that we put there as well. All of these classes are called inside this class, and then whenever there needs to be user input, the user input class is used, and when something needs to be placed on the board, the game board object is called. This way of programming allows information to be encapsulated into different objects, like the ships in the player 1's board can be kept in the player 1 gameboard, and the player 2's ships can be kept in the player 2 gameboard. This was the easy way of seeing that the previous group used object oriented programming, but it was also very apparent from the way that the code was set up. It looked very similar to the way we were taught to code in EECS 168 and 268, which also made it pretty easy to read what their code was doing as well. Overall we think that they used object oriented programming due to the way that their code was setup as well as how it looked.
